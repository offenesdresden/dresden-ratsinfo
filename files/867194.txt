NIM JUNDOOSING
ARTIST
BIOGRAPHY

Nim Jundoosing is a multidisciplinary artist based
in Dresden, Germany, originally from Mauritius.
Her practice spans painting, writing, ceramics, and
installation, blending traditional techniques with
contemporary forms. With a background in interior
design, she brings a nuanced understanding of
space, material, and composition to her visual
language.
Nim’s work engages with themes of identity,
gender, and cultural stigma. Through inquisitive
imagery, she explores how desire, sexuality, and
the body are shaped and often silenced by
inherited cultural narratives. Her body of work
reflects a process of reclamation: confronting
societal taboos and opening space for
vulnerability, pleasure, and autonomy.
Rooted in a feminist perspective, her practice is
both intimate and political. It invites the viewer
into a dialogue between personal experience and
questions of belonging, freedom, and the power of
representation.

MIXED MEDIA PAINTING
“SHORES OF GAZA”

The other day, I sat in the studio, my
mind wandered off to the notion of
Peace. What does it mean? How do
we reach it? Is it only a dream?
It is interesting how our minds
associate peace with heaven, how
our heads tilt upward, as if the sky
holds it.
As I sit with my own pain and
wonder if I will ever reach it, my
thoughts turn to the children of
Gaza and the many families
destroyed. How many of them look
up to the sky and dream of peace.
Will they ever find it? And if they do,
will it be enough? Or will they
always wonder...

Mixed Media: Paper, Ink, Watercolour, Red Yarn

NIM JUNDOOSING
INSTALLATION
“THE WOMB”

The piece draws from a childhood ritual once performed
for Shani Dev, the planetary deity of karma and discipline
– tying red threads around the Peepal tree for protection.
What began as an instructed gesture is now reclaimed
as a personal offering, reframed through the lens of the
body, memory, and choice. The red thread becomes
more than a symbol of protection; it carries associations
with blood, fertility, desire, war, love, and death. These
layered meanings sit at the core of the work.
The number nine, considered sacred in Hindu
cosmology, appears as a structural and symbolic
element. It is linked to divine creation, the 9 planetary
system, and the feminine cycle of transformation
(Navaratri). Here, the 9 red threads mark the rhythm of
repetition, transition, and return. The Womb is not a
reenactment of ritual, but a transformation of it – a
space shaped by the influence of Kali. It invites reflection
on how power can emerge through powerlessness, and
how love, when chosen freely, becomes its own kind of
protection.

Dimension: 42 D x 43 L x 25 H cm
Medium: Plaster Cement, Twigs, Red Thread, Kidney Bean

MIXED MEDIA PAINTING

“PISSING KALI"

This work is a return to Kali, both as goddess and as an
ancestral figure. For me, Kali is many things at once—mother,
sister, divine feminine, a fierce and strong woman. In my
culture, calling her the “pissing Kali” would be seen as
disrespectful, but for me it is an act of provocation and
reclamation. I wanted to celebrate her for everything she
holds: empathy, rage, boldness, strength, and love. Through
her seven facets, I explore how family traditions, inherited
fears, and ancestral power shape my own experience as a
woman.

Dimensions: 50 x 70 cm
Mixed Media: Paper, Ink, Red Thread

“TO, OUR MOTHERS,
OUR DAUGHTERS, OUR
SISTERS"
Created during a period of menstruation, this collage
confronts the often-taboo subjects of menstruation and
sexual violence. Using blood as a symbol, the piece reflects
on the interconnectedness of women’s experiences, exploring
empathy, trauma, and silence. It invites viewers to reflect on
the shared struggles that unite women across generations,
while
challenging
societal
taboos
around
these
personal/traumatic, often silenced, experiences.

Dimension: 148.5 x 210 mm
Mixed Media: Paper, Tissue Paper, Ink, Chalk Pastel

NIM JUNDOOSING
SCULPTURE
“POSEIDON THE DICKHEAD”

This piece humorously critiques Poseidon, who in mythology
assaulted Medusa in Athena’s temple. Instead of him being
punished, Medusa was transformed into a monster and
blamed — a story that reflects how survivors are often
silenced and vilified in patriarchal societies.
Medusa’s anger is justified, and this work honors that. Here,
the roles are reversed: Poseidon wears a crown of phallic
symbols, his cold, intimidating gaze driving women away. It’s
a satirical call-out of toxic masculinity and the lasting impact
of blaming victims rather than perpetrators.

Materials: Foam, Plaster, Fabrics, Fluff Pulp.
Dimensions: 55L x 37D x 76H cm

“WASSER”
Nim and Cléo met with the wish to share their words.
They soon realized those words were filled with water.
From the current, two landscapes emerged — mirrored yet
distinct, like puzzle pieces of the mind.
Now, they invite you to step inside.
Come visit the story that water shaped.
Ceramic forms and fragments of text flow together in the
space. Two voices, shaped apart, yet drawn by the same tide.
This installation invites the viewer to step into a shared
current: Water.

Collaborative Installation work with
French artist Cléo Munro for
NYMFE ART FESTIVAL, Chemnitz,
Germany.
Medium: Installation, Video
Projection, Ceramic, Poetry-Writing.
Year: May 2025

From different origins, we followed its pull, and met.
It is here , in what sets us apart that resonance begins.
Difference does not divide, but deepens the story we tell
together.

NIM JUNDOOSING
PAINTING
“UNTOLD”
Isn't it ironic how we disregard life contained in a rubber bag? The
condom, a simple object often dismissed and scorned, might
have a deeper story to tell. Can this be considered an act of
cruelty?
A condom has traveled to many places, both known and
unknown. It has touched realms of mediocrity and mystery.
Despite having much to say, it is an item that has been constantly
banalized through time, walking a path of shame, mockery,
ridicule, use, and horror.
If a condom could have a life, I wonder how it would feel. Would it
inherit its predecessor's life adventures and traumas? As a
preventer of life, are you sad or happy? What do you feel, knowing
that you cannot give birth? As a preventer of sensations, are you
okay with limiting your owner's pleasure? How do you feel about
causing discomfort?
Dear Condom, I wish you could tell me stories of your adventures.
Where have you been? What have you experienced? Did you enjoy
the actions of your masters? Did you witness things that you
should not have? Do you have regrets?

Dimension: 1.95 m x 1.5 m
Medium: Oil on Canvas

If you could speak, or if you did not exist, would the world be in
chaos? Or would the environment breathe free? How do you feel
when people use you and then discard you as if you were trash?
Wait, do you consider yourself trash? How does it feel to be a
protector on one hand, yet a nuisance to society on the other? I
call you a nuisance because that is how you are treated, not
because I am judging you. You serve people, yet you are trashed
by them and blamed for their actions. Do you find this fair? It is
quite hypocritical, isn’t it?
Do you ever wonder why humans do not take responsibility for
their actions? Why they sometimes leave you to rot in the streets,
only to be scrutinized? You are often regarded as disgusting. Do
you feel disgusting, or do you feel like you are dying? Do you think
humans are scared of you because you stink or because you
might carry diseases? How do you cope with this kind of
repulsion?
Dear Condom, you are a source of pleasure, protection, and life.
Holder of secrets, you are also an agent of dominance, constraint,
and invasion—yet, paradoxically, you can offer nourishment. Why
have we turned you into something absurd and disgusting, rather
than honoring your role?
Dear Condom, I bow to your strength, for enduring both the good
and the bad with the dignity you deserve.

INSTALLATION
“ON A BED OF ROSES”
“On a Bed of Roses” is an installation that transforms intimate
emotions, previously explored in my writing, into a visual and
spatial experience. The work consists of 16 ceramic rose petals,
arranged on a bed of sand.
The installation draws inspiration from a French text I wrote,
capturing the emotional essence of the work:
Étalés comme des pétales de roses sur un lit de printemps, nous
écoutions nos battements de cœur…
Entre nous, on se perdait dans nos regards, échangeant quelques
sourires. Parfois, quand c’était trop intense, une larme s’échappait,
glissant comme l’eau sur des pétales.
C’était un au revoir.
Un adieu,
Que l’on n’avait pas vu venir.
C’était rose, comme les pétales qui se fanent sans eau.

Installation on the floor with sand.

Dimension: 3m x 3m
Medium: Ceramic

NIM JUNDOOSING
PAINTING

“LANDSCAPES”
The work explores the idea of
inheritance. Here, I navigate pain
through love & absence.

Medium: Water Color & Collage
Dimensions: 297 x 420 mm

I now roam the landscapes
Amidst tribes,
Searching for kindred souls—
Those who pass no judgment,
Whose will is that of freedom and love to conquer all. As I
walk these landscapes, I see the pain in anger... I see the
pain in silence... I see the pain in euphoria...
Where are you?
Where will I find you again, Love?
As I walk these surfaces, I see everything but you, lightness.
As I walk, alone... through earth, the wait feels eternal.
What am I to do with the pain I meet?
Be an observer or an activist?
As I walk this land, I feel a becoming—
A spiritual awakening,
A sense of detachment.
As I walk this earth, I look for answers, and I look for you.
I look for you…

VIDEO MIT TEXT
Der Fluss den ich auf meiner Reise gesehen habe, war
viel schöner als der Fluss den ich bisher immer gesehen habe.
Es war das erstes Mal , dass ich ihn so sehe. und ich weiss
nicht ob ich ihn nächste Mal wieder mit diesen Augen sehen
werde.Was ich überdeutlich auf meinem Weg empfand, war der
Klang des Lichtes.Der Lärm des Lichts war sogar zu laut ,
jedoch waren die Bäume hingegen relativ ruhig.Das Leuchten
der dort auf meinem Weg aufgestellten Gebäude die Ampeln
und die Lichter der Autos waren auf einen Blick erkennbar.
und die Farben waren so klar und laut.Es war so laut , dass
ich mich beinahe entzweireisste.im Gegensatz dazu waren
die Bäume schwer, noch warm und still.Das Aura der Bäume
war so verbindend das es mich zu ihnen zog.Sie warene eine
ideale Familie. Die Zweige waren so stark bemüht jedes Blatt
zu halten.und die Blätter die abgerisseen wurden , die sich
zurück sehnten sahen so schäbig und traurig aus. Die Luft im
Haus war sehr dunkel, als ich auf meiner Reise nach drinnen
geführt wurde.Es fühlte sich nach so wenig Luft an Dass ich
nicht atmen konnte und meine Brust fühlte sich leer an . Sie
war zu schwer mit jedem Atemzug wurde das Gewicht deutlich
spürbar. ich schätze sie war ungefähr 2 Klio schwer. andererseits war die Luft draussen so leicht,als ob man in ihr
schweben würde.so seltsam,als ob es keine schwerkraft gäbe.
Es fühlte sich an , als ob mein körper und mein Kopf voneinander getrennt wurden. Ich konnte meinem ganzen Körper und
meinen Geist pararell stillschweigend erleben.Normalerweise
geht der Körper den ganzen Tag und mein Geist kann kontinuierlich mit kommunizieren . Doch auf meiner Reise fühlte ich
mich ,wie wenn mein Geist hinter mienme gehenden Körper
schwebte.in diesem Moment hatt ich Zweifel daran , ob ich
meine Reise weiterführen könnte. Meine Sinne fühlten sich
vorher so insignifikant an.doch nun fühlt es sich an als
wären alle Sinne Wieder in der richtigen Position . vor allem
waren sie stabiler und empfindlicher als je zuvor. Der Klang
wurde wieder Sehbar der Geruch duch sein Gewicht spürbar
und die gesehenen Objekte wurden in ihrer Struktur Hörbar.
Ich weiss dass dies eine gefährlicher Zustand sein kann,
aber durch diese Reise kam ich endlich aus meiner Höhle.Und
fühlte mich als ob ich die wahre Natur dieses Universums
sehen könnte.In dieser Höhle führte kein Schritt zur Wahrheit, auch wenn wir zurück zum Mars gingen wurden,wäre dieses
Problem nicht gelöst.Die Erkenntnis von dieser Reise,ist die
Trennung von Körper und Geist.In meinem Alter jedóch ist
mein Körper und Geist bei dieser Divergenz in Gefahr,auf
diesem von mir erlebten Weg.Ich habe also danach eine Mittelpunkt gefunden und mich an diesen gewöhnt.Es gibt jedoch
durch dieses Paradigma sehr viele psychische und Physische
Fehler im Leben.Da ich jedoch daran gewöhnt bin,werde ich
nicht hundertmal täglich vom Atmen erbrechen,anders als ob
ich jeden Tag auf der Erde leben würde.Aber ich war auch
dankbar für diese Reise, sie war so schön, so ekstatisch.

die zeit vergeht langsam, solange ich aus dem fenster sehe. farben bleiben unter verschluss,
doch das vakuum im kopf füllt die leere. das warten wird ein ende 昀椀nden – morgen, übermorgen,

Unikat

Ein Schlüsselanhänger mit einer Regenbogenkugel
aus Epoxidharz. Je nach Blickwinkel variiert die
Farbigkeit der Kugel und imitiert die Funktion einer
Wahrsagekugel. Ein Item für die kleinen Glücksmomente im Alltag, wenn einen der Frust zu überrollen
droht. Dennoch kein Nutzobjekt, da viel zu fragil.
Die Kugel bricht mit der eigentlichen Funktion
eines Schlüsselanhängers und fordert eine neue
Betrachtungsart für ein Nutzobjekt, das zu einem
emp昀椀ndsamen Ausstellungsstück geworden ist.

Epoxidharz, Schlüsselanhänger-Ring, Kugel 1 cm Ø,
Gesamtlänge 5 cm
